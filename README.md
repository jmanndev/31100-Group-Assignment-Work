## Code Standards ##
### Project ###
- Backing fields (AKA class variables) that are used in calculated Properties should have an underscore prefix so we know which class variable has a Property that we should be using instead. Especially when displaying the Property to the user.
  E.g.
  ```c
  private String _score;
  public String Score
  {
    get { return "Score: " + _score; }
    private set { _score = value; }
  }

  private int serverPoint, receiverPoint; // no need for underscore prefix
  ```
  **Unless** the backing field isn't going to be referenced anywhere else in the code AND the Property that uses the backing field is a simple get and set, then just remove the backing field.
  E.g.
  ```c
  // acceptable
  public int StudentID { get; private set; }
  
  // also acceptable but we should really pick the above or this one and stick with it
  public int StudentID
  {
    get;
    private set;
  }

  // Not acceptable as the backing field is just unused and there's redundant code.
  private int _studentID;
  public int StudentID
  {
    get { return _studentID; }
    private set { _studentID = value; }
  }
  ```
- Boolean class variables should be named with an `is` (or `are` for plurals) prefix,  e.g. `public bool isApproved` or `public bool areValidEntries`
- Tab spaces. Use default VS2015 Community settings which seems to be Tab Size 4. Indent Size 4. Insert Spaces.
### Version Control ###
- For each commit message, have it start with an active verb. E.g. `Update code standards on README file.`
